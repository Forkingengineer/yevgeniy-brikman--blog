- name: "Fundamentals of DevOps and Software Delivery"
  date: "2024"
  description: |
   This book is a guide to software delivery: that is, all the processes, tools, and techniques that are required to
   run software in production and maintain it on an ongoing basis. In particular, this book is a guide to DevOps, one
   of the methodologies used today to make software delivery vastly more efficient. Whereas most DevOps content tends
   to focus primarily on culture and theory, this book is a hands-on guide that includes dozens of examples that walk
   you, step-by-step, through how to run real systems and real code. You’ll start with the basics—running a single
   server—and work all the way up to Kubernetes clusters, automated deployment pipelines, distributed data systems, and
   more.

    An open source project that brings BigPipe streaming to the Play Framework.
    It includes tools for a) splitting your pages up into small "pagelets",

    pagelets down to the browser as soon as they are ready, which can
    significantly reduce page load time.
