Today, I'm excited to announce my new book! It's called _[Fundamentals of DevOps and Software 
Delivery]({{ page.external_url }})_, and it's a comprehensive, hands-on guide to 
deploying and managing software in production, written for practitioners.

Readers of _[Terraform: Up & Running]({{ site.terraform_up_and_running_url}}?ref=ybrikman-early-release-blog-post)_ 
often asked me to recommend a general, comprehensive, practical book on DevOps. I couldn't find oneâ€”so I wrote it. 
It covers orchestration (VMs, K8S, serverless), IaC, CI/CD, networking, data storage, secrets management, monitoring, 
and more:

This is not another book on DevOps culture. This is a hands-on guide that includes dozens of step-by-step examples that 
will have you running real systems: e.g., you'll deploy Kubernetes clusters in AWS, manage infrastructure with 
OpenTofu, set up CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions, etc:

In the spirit of "ship early and often," I'm releasing this before it's done. The book is now available on the 
following platforms:

* Blog post series on the [Gruntwork website](https://www.gruntwork.io/fundamentals-of-devops?ref=ybrikman-early-release-blog-post) (free).
* Early release of the e-book on the [O'Reilly Platform](http://oreillymedia.pxf.io/c/5553902/2077261/15173) _([30-day free trial](https://oreillymedia.pxf.io/c/5553902/2074898/15173))_.
* Pre-order the paper book on [Amazon](https://amzn.to/3VZaRxu) and [Barnes & Noble](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/fundamentals-of-devops-and-software-delivery-jim-brikman/1145837544).

I hope you find the book useful. And if you read it, I'd _love_ to hear your feedback: I'm still writing, so this is 
your chance to help shape the book!
